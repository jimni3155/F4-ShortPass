### S3 Refactoring Summary

The application has been refactored to use S3 for storing full transcripts, filtered evidence, and agent logs. This includes:

- **Full Transcript Storage**: Implemented in `server/services/interview_service_v2.py`, where the full transcript is assembled and uploaded at the end of the interview. The S3 URL is stored in the `InterviewSession` table.
- **Filtered Evidence Storage**: Implemented in `server/services/evaluation/evaluation_service.py`, where the detailed competency evaluation results are bundled and uploaded to S3. The S3 URL is stored in the `Evaluation` table.
- **Agent Log Storage**: Implemented in `server/ai/agents/base_agent.py`, where agent execution logs are saved to S3.

### File Changes

- **Created**:
    - `server/services/storage/s3_service.py`: Contains the core S3 service logic.
    - `server/add_evidence_s3_url_migration.sql`: SQL script to add the `evidence_s3_url` column to the `evaluations` table.
- **Modified**:
    - `server/ai/agents/base_agent.py`: Integrated `S3Service` to store agent logs.
    - `server/services/interview_service_v2.py`: Integrated `S3Service` to store full transcripts.
    - `server/api/evaluation.py`: Updated to handle S3-based transcript retrieval for evaluations.
    - `server/models/evaluation.py`: Added `evidence_s3_url` column to the `Evaluation` model.
    - `server/services/evaluation/evaluation_service.py`: Integrated `S3Service` to store filtered evidence.
